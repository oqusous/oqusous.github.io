      <p>
        Developed a content-based “comparison shopping tool” car recommender using an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm. It is a tool to make 
        car hunting less of daunting endeavor for users. The shopper enters their favorite or budgeted-for car brand and model and the recommender 
        will provide cars with similar characteristics such as fuel economy, performance, cost and size.

      <p>
        The project aims to build Univariate models to forecast NASDAQ stock index’s price using Python programming language. The data and its source 
        are first introduced and the need for such tool is explored. The data is then processed in order to keep 5500 datapoints, converted to the appropriate 
        data types, the target variable is set as the close stock price and then split into 1:5 testing to training datapoints. The data is then is made stationary 
        by differencing the log of the data. Through time decomposition, it is determined that the data has a strong trend and weak seasonality.
        The data is then modeled using Average, Naïve, Simple Exponential Smoothening, Holt’s linear, Holt-Winter Seasonal, ARMA and ARIMA methods. At the end of 
        experimenting with each model, the best one-step forecast is determined to be Holt Linear method and the best h-step predictor is ARIMA with order (3,1,4).

      <p>
        Created an ensemble decision tree classification algorithm that helps entrepreneurs seeking funds from crowdfunding website to predict whether their project will 
        succeed or fail on Kickstarter. The users enter the project’s category (Film, Music, Fashion etc..), country where project is based in, 
        dates of creation and deadline and the budget desired. I am currently in the process of apply the similar algorithm to gofundme.com and indiegogo.com 
        order to create a comparison tool that helps users pick the right website for their project.

      <p>
        The classifier determines what genre a movie is based on its script. Web-scraped scripts of movies from 3 different genres.
        * Romance
        * Horror
        * Fantasy 
        These were chosen because it was deemed they would have the least overlap.
        Using Multinomial Naive Bayes model, accuracy acheived was 32% above the baseline model.

      <p>
        The remarkable advances in image recognition technology through Machine Learning algorithims has lead many businesses of different presuaions 
        to seek utilizing its uses. It is applied in areas such as social media image tagging, self-driving car technology, security and medical research. 
        This project aims to assess the accuracy of a built-from-scratch CNN model and a ResNet50 pre-trained transfer learning CNN model in distingushing leukemic B-lymphoblast 
        cells from healthy B-lymphoid precursors. The images are microscopic images of blood smear samples for patients who are healthy and others who have been diagnosed with 
        Leukemia.

            Predicts price of used cars for 43 brands for models between 2014-2018 using linear regression.

         <p>
            This project aimed to explore and analyze movie and actor data, with the aim of deriving insights to advise a fictional start-up movie studio on ways to maximize profits and ensure success.
            The idea of “personal brands” is growing through social media - actors & actresses have been able to advertise their projects more than ever before. 
            We will focus on movie casts and their overall public brands for this analysis.

        <p>
           Keras is used to define and train a CNN model to recognize images for either being that of dogs or cars.
