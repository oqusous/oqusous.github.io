      <p>
         Using Spotify's Annoy API, a car recommender machine learning code is built. 
         The user inputs a favourite car of theirs and the model gives recommendations of different car brands/models based on the characteristics of the given car.

      <p>
        The aim of this project is to build a Classification Model to predict whether or not a new project on Kickstarter is likely succeed or fail.
        Using logestic regression, accuracy was improved by 17% when compared to the baseline model.

      <p>
        The classifier determines what genre a movie is based on its script. Web-scraped scripts of movies from 3 different genres.
        * Romance
        * Horror
        * Fantasy 
        These were chosen because it was deemed they would have the least overlap.
        Using Multinomial Naive Bayes model, accuracy acheived was 32% above the baseline model.

          <h3>Used car price predictor</h3></a>
        <p>
            Predicts price of used cars for 43 brands for models between 2014-2018 using linear regression.

         <p>
            This project aimed to explore and analyze movie and actor data, with the aim of deriving insights to advise a fictional start-up movie studio on ways to maximize profits and ensure success.
            The idea of “personal brands” is growing through social media - actors & actresses have been able to advertise their projects more than ever before. 
            We will focus on movie casts and their overall public brands for this analysis.
