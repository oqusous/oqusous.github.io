    <li> <a href="https://github.com/oqusous/car_recommendation_"title="Car Recommender"><h3> Car Recommender</h3></a>
      <p>
        Developed a content-based “comparison shopping tool” car recommender using an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm. It is a tool to make 
        car hunting less of daunting endeavor for users. The shopper enters their favorite or budgeted-for car brand and model and the recommender 
        will provide cars with similar characteristics such as fuel economy, performance, cost and size.

    <li> <a href="https://github.com/oqusous/Kickstarter_project" title="Kick Starter Project Predictor"><h3> Kickstarter Project Success Predictor </h3></a>
      <p>
        Created an ensemble decision tree classification algorithm that helps entrepreneurs seeking funds from crowdfunding website to predict whether their project will 
        succeed or fail on Kickstarter. The users enter the project’s category (Film, Music, Fashion etc..), country where project is based in, 
        dates of creation and deadline and the budget desired. I am currently in the process of apply the similar algorithm to gofundme.com and indiegogo.com 
        order to create a comparison tool that helps users pick the right website for their project.

    <li><a href="https://github.com/oqusous/Movie-scripts-classifier" title="Movie Script Classifier"><h3>Move Script Classifier</h3></a>
      <p>
        The classifier determines what genre a movie is based on its script. Web-scraped scripts of movies from 3 different genres.
        * Romance
        * Horror
        * Fantasy 
        These were chosen because it was deemed they would have the least overlap.
        Using Multinomial Naive Bayes model, accuracy acheived was 32% above the baseline model.

          <h3>Used car price predictor</h3></a>
        <p>
            Predicts price of used cars for 43 brands for models between 2014-2018 using linear regression.

         <p>
            This project aimed to explore and analyze movie and actor data, with the aim of deriving insights to advise a fictional start-up movie studio on ways to maximize profits and ensure success.
            The idea of “personal brands” is growing through social media - actors & actresses have been able to advertise their projects more than ever before. 
            We will focus on movie casts and their overall public brands for this analysis.

        <p>
           Keras is used to define and train a CNN model to recognize images for either being that of dogs or cars.
